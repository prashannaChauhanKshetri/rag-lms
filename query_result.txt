3. Querying: 'What is the name of the first chapter?'

📝 Answer:
Unfortunately, the provided textbook excerpts do not explicitly mention the title of the first chapter (Page 3, Page 49, Page 57, Page 35, Page 62). The excerpts appear to be from various sections of the book, including an introduction (Page 3), a discussion on amphibians (Page 49), exercises and questions (Page 57, Page 62), and a description of the phylum porifera (Page 35). 

However, we can gather some general information about the book. The book is a science and technology textbook for Grade 10 students, published by the Curriculum Development Centre (Page 3). The language of the book has been edited by Ms. Kunti Adhikari, and the art editing was done by Mr. Shreehari Shrestha (Page 3). 

Since the title of the first chapter is not mentioned in the provided excerpts, we cannot provide a definitive answer to the student's question. If more information or excerpts from the book were provided, we might be able to find the title of the first chapter. 

In summary, this specific information is not in the provided text (Page 3, Page 49, Page 57, Page 35, Page 62).
